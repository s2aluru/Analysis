I'm a Data Scientist and a Principal Software Engineer with passion for developing end to end data solutions. I have 16 years of experience implementing enterprise wide software solutions in Health sciences using various Microsoft, Java, Oracle technologies. 
<br/><br/>
I got interested in Data Science about 5 years ago after reading how data can help improve products, services, customer experience and pursued online course to learn about statistics, machine learning and completed online <a href="https://credentials.edx.org/credentials/112d93eb68e5489ab0cde4589a0335fa/"> Micro-Masters degree</a> in Data Science from University of San Deigo in Decemeber 2018. After completing the degree, I have done freelancing for couple of companies and delivered useful insights, predictions using Machine Learning. I want to use my Data Science and Software Engineering experience to build data driven solutions involving all phases (data collection, analysis, prediction, deployment) and find actionable insights.
<br/><br/>
This repository contains Data Science projects I have done out of my personal interest. They are developed using Jupyter notebooks and Python. Listed below is the description of projects with a link to Html and source file.

  <li> This classification analysis involves exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, prediction using ensemble techniques, error analysis and model interpretation. It is a Jupyter notebook with packages such as numpy, pandas, seaborn, sklearn, shap, joblib  with sklearn packages.

	 <br/>
	 <li> This project is to classify IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative using deep learning techniques such as LSTM and CNN. I built multiple models using basic LSTM, LSTM with dropout, LSTM with dropout on LSTM layer and recurrent input layer, CNN, CNN with Flatten and Fully Connected Network. The training times were 18, 15, 25, 6, 1 minutes respectively. It was interesting to find that LSTM with Flatten and FCN took least amount of time with comparable accuracy of 88%.

<tr><td><a href="https://s2aluru.github.io/DSProjects/Html/Student Performance Prediction.html">Student Performance Prediction</a>
  <br/>
 <li>  As part of Micro-Masters final project, predicted studentsâ€™ final GPA using various regression models with evaluation metric as RMSE (<a href="https://github.com/s2aluru/Analysis/blob/master/Student%20Performance%20Prediction.ipynb">Code</a>)
 </li>
		<li>Used K-fold, Cross Validation, Grid Search techniques for Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree and Random Forest regression models from scikit-learn package.</li>
 </td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="https://s2aluru.github.io/DSProjects/Html/Sentiment Analysis on Allergy tweets.html">Sentiment Analysis on Allergy tweets</a> <br/>
  <li> Performed sentiment analysis on latest tweets on allergy and plotted sentiments within USA to get locations of allergy sufferers using Python, tweepy, nltk, geocoder, bigrams, textblob, plotly packages. (<a href="https://github.com/s2aluru/Analysis/blob/master/Sentiment%20Analysis%20on%20Allergy%20tweets.ipynb">Code</a>)

<tr><td><a href="https://s2aluru.github.io/DSProjects/Html/Staff Compensation.html">Staff Compensation</a>
  <br/>
  <li> As part of Micro-Masters mid term project, analyzed countries around the world and determined that Staff compensation doesn't necessarily go up with education expenditure and of the 20 countries Mexico's 'teacher compensation to expenditure' ratio is high (<a href="https://github.com/s2aluru/Analysis/blob/master/Staff%20Compensation.ipynb">Code</a>)
